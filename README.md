# MASShortcut

Prior to Xcode 4 we used the framework [ShortcutRecorder](http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/). However, it is incompatible with a new plugin architecture.

This set of classes is a modern interface for recording and storing global keyboard shortcuts. The repository has ARC-enabled Objective-C code compatible with OS X 10.8 and its sandboxed environment. Enjoy!
